# Introduction to [I]Python

### Installation Instructions
Please download and install the [Anaconda Distribution for Python](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).

**Remark**: [[known issue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23343484/python-3-statsmodels)] statsmodels 0.5.0 doesn't yet work with Python 3.4

For Mac and Linux users, open up your terminal. Windows users need to open up their Command Prompt. Change directories in the terminal (using the `cd` command) to the working directory where you want to store your IPython Notebook data.

To run IPython Notebook, enter the following command:

	ipython notebook

It may take a minute or two to set itself up, but eventually IPython Notebook will open in your default web browser. For a brief introduction to the IPython notebook, visit the following link: [introduction to the IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esc/scipy2013-tutorial-numpy-ipython/blob/master/ipython.ipynb). For more details, visit the [IPython website](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

**Remark**: Currently, IPython Notebook only supports Firefox and Chrome.

### Assignment
Run the `README.ipynb` notebook by entering the command:

	ipython notebook README.ipynb

Run the code the notebook, and save the output to a .txt file.  Submit the file to Stellar.

The first two lines of your output should look like:

```
                            OLS Regression Results                            
==============================================================================
```
